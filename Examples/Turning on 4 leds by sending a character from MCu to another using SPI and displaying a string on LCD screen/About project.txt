This project is about communication between 2 microcontrollers using SPI.

MCU1:

if M is sent then 4 leds are turned on MCU2 and a string is immediately displayed 
on LCD screen "Leds are ON" and a DC Motor is moved forward.

if S is sent then the 4 leds are turned off on MCU2  and a string is immediately displayed 
on LCD screen "Leds are OFF" and a DC Motor is moved reverse.
